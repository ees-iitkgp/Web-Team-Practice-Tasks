/*
Basic Javascript Concepts: Functions

Task:
	1. Define a function `titleCase` which takes in a string and converts into title-case.
	Title case refers to only the first letter being capitalized. Example: "Deez nuts"

	2. Define a function `factorial` which operates using recursion to calculate the factorial of a natural numcber.

	3. Define a function `logger` which takes in arguments and displays them one by one. 
	Implement this using both the `function ()` notation and the ` => ` notation

Note: Your submission may use normal `function ()` definitions but it is advised 
that you use the arrow function notation generally.
