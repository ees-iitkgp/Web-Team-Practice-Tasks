/*
More Javascript Concepts: async... await

Task:
	1. A coin flip is expected to take at least 2.6 seconds and at most 5 seconds. The time taken is somewhat random.
	Using the function coinFlipPromise which returns the coin flip after a given time, define a function `coinFlips`
	The function will take an argument `n` which defines the number of coin flips within a given time.
	The function must generate `n` coin flips one after the other and display the output of each of them.

	For example:
	coinFlips(2)

	Output:
	Heads		(at t = 3.47s)
	Heads		(at t = 8.62s)

	Note: The time (t = x s) does not have to be displayed 

	2. Rewrite the function `responseHandler` into an async function `asyncResponseHandler`
